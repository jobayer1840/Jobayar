    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:aliceblue"> Bangladesh </h1>
                          
      <p style="color:aqua">My country's name is Bangladesh. It is situated in eastern South Asia and is bordered by the Bay of Bengal in the south, India, and Myanmar to the east, and just India to the west. Its general area is 147,570 square kilometers, including waterways. It achieved independence after a brutal liberation fight. Approximately three million men and women gave their lives for the cause of independence. After attaining independence, the newborn nation went through many difficult times and challenges. However, it rises nicely. Bangladesh is now one of the greatest places to live in South Asia. There are so many beautiful places to see in our nation. Bangladesh is a tiny nation. However, it has a huge population. This little country is populated by around 120 million people. Here, the population density is high. About 800 people reside in a square kilometer. Bangladesh is predominantly an agricultural nation, with the majority of its population being farmers. However, it remains a very beautiful and peaceful nation. People in Bangladesh are exceedingly kind to one another.

          It is one of the world's most beautiful nations, with its lush green landscapes and plenty of trees and flora. Cox's Bazaar is the longest sea beach in the world. The Sundarban is one of the world's largest mangrove forests and a tremendous source of beauty. There you may locate Royal Bengal Tiger. I love my nation a great deal. I was blessed to be born here.</p>
