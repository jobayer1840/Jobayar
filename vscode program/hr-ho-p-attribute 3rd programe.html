      <h1 align="center"> Bangladesh </h1> <hr/>
       
     <p> My countryâ€™s name is Bangladesh.
      It is situated in eastern South Asia and is bordered by the Bay of Bengal in the south, India, and Myanmar to the east, and just India to the west.
      Its general area is 147,570 square kilometers, including waterways. It achieved independence after a brutal liberation fight. </p>

     <p>Approximately three million men and women gave their lives for the cause of independence.
     After attaining independence, the newborn nation went through many difficult times and challenges. However, it rises nicely.
     Bangladesh is now one of the greatest places to live in South Asia. There are so many beautiful places to see in our nation.</p>
           
    <p>Bangladesh is a tiny nation. However, it has a huge population.</p>
